    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Targeted Genomic Surveillance\n",
    "\n",
    "Targeted genomic surveillance through amplicon sequencing has emerged as\n",
    "a powerful tool for monitoring disease vectors. This approach allows us\n",
    "to focus on specific genomic regions of interest while being more\n",
    "cost-effective than whole genome sequencing. For vector surveillance,\n",
    "this enables tracking of insecticide resistance mutations, species\n",
    "identification markers, and other important genetic variants across\n",
    "populations. The Ag-vampIR platform, recently developed for *Anopheles\n",
    "gambiae*, demonstrates how targeted sequencing can provide critical\n",
    "insights for vector control programs. Today, we’ll learn how to extend\n",
    "this approach to other disease vectors using two key tools: IRTHO and\n",
    "MULTIPLY.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Find orthologous insecticide resistance loci in your target vector\n",
    "    species using IRTHO\n",
    "2.  Design a multiplexed PCR primer panel targeting these loci using\n",

    "## The Ag-vampIR Panel\n",
    "\n",
    "Ag-vampIR (Anopheles gambiae Vector Amplicon Marker Panel for\n",
    "Insecticide Resistance) is a targeted sequencing panel designed for\n",
    "genomic surveillance of malaria vectors. The panel targets 90 important\n",
    "genomic loci across 80 amplicons in the Anopheles gambiae genome,\n",
    "including:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   55 insecticide resistance-associated SNPs\n",
    "    -   Target-site mutations (kdr, Ace1, Rdl)\n",
    "    -   Metabolic resistance markers\n",
    "    -   SNPs tagging selective sweeps\n",
    "-   35 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) for species identification\n",
    "-   Two amplicons targeting the doublesex gene drive locus\n",
    "\n",
    "Each amplicon is approximately 200 bp long. The protocols design allows\n",
    "multiplexing of up to 1,536 samples on a single flow cell using dual\n",
    "indexing with 96 i7 and 16 i5 adaptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The AmpSeeker Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "AmpSeeker is an open-source computational pipeline designed for\n",
    "reproducible analysis of amplicon sequencing data, which can analyze\n",
    "data from any Illumina amplicon sequencing panel. The pipeline is built\n",
    "using Snakemake for reproducibility and automation.\n",

    "## Part 1: Introduction to IRTHO\n",
    "\n",
    "IRTHO is a Python package that identifies orthologous loci between\n",
    "reference genomes using OrthoFinder. This is crucial for translating\n",
    "known resistance mutations from well-studied vectors to related species.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key capabilities: - Identifies orthologous genes between species -\n",
    "Determines synteny between orthologous genes - Aligns protein sequences\n",
    "to find orthologous positions of amino acid residues\n",
    "\n",
    "![IRTHO Workflow](https://placeholder-for-irtho-workflow.png) *Figure 2:\n",
    "IRTHO workflow diagram*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Available Reference Genomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently available in pre-computed OrthoFinder results: - Aedes aegypti\n",
    "(LVP_AGWG) - Aedes albopictus (AalbF5) - Anopheles gambiae (PEST) -\n",
    "Anopheles stephensi (UCISS2018) - Culex quinquefasciatus (JHB2020) -\n",
    "Additional vectors can be added using protein FASTA and GFF files from\n",
    "VectorBase or RefSeq\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Introduction to MULTIPLY\n",
    "\n",
    "MULTIPLY is a command-line tool for designing multiplexed PCR primers.\n",
    "It was recently described in Nature Communications and supports both\n",
    "Illumina and Nanopore sequencing approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "![MULTIPLY\n",
    "Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasonAHendry/multiply/master/.images/multiply-pipeline.png)\n",
    "*Figure 3: MULTIPLY pipeline overview*\n",
    "\n",
    "Key steps: 1. Generates candidate primers using Primer3 2. Checks for\n",
    "SNPs in primer binding sites 3. Evaluates potential primer dimers 4.\n",
    "Assesses off-target amplification 5. Optimizes primer combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing amplicon panels, it is important to consider these\n",
    "factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amplicon Size**: For Illumina sequencing, aim for ~200bp to enable\n",
    "complete coverage with paired-end reads and maximize sequencing\n",
    "efficiency. For Nanopore, amplicons can be 400-3000bp.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primer Specificity**: Design primers 18-22 bases long with 40-60% GC\n",
    "content and similar melting temperatures (57-63°C) to ensure specific\n",
    "amplification of target regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genetic Variation**: Check existing population genomic data to avoid\n",
    "placing primers over known polymorphic sites, which can cause allele\n",
    "dropout and false negatives. Multiply can take a BED file of SNP\n",
    "locations and consider this when selecting optimal primers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiplexing Compatibility**: Avoid complementary sequences between\n",
    "primers that could form dimers, and aim for similar GC content and\n",
    "amplicon sizes. Multiply takes care of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequencing Platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop can be used to design amplicon panels for both Illumina\n",
    "and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. Illumina enables use\n",
    "of the AmpSeeker pipeline and is consistent with the ongoing training in\n",
    "the EAVES and WAVES projects. The only modification needed for Nanopore\n",
    "would be adjusting amplicon size in MULTIPLY.\n",
